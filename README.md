### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics - Meets Expectations
* Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long

* Some enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen
* At least one hash is implemented in a way that makes logical sense


### Test Driven Development - Meets Expectations
* Every method is tested at both the unit and integration level, and completely verify expected behavior
* Obvious edge cases are addressed
* Git history demonstrates students are writing tests before implementation code
* Test coverage metrics show coverage at 99% or greater


### Version Control - Well Above Expectations
* At least 40 commits
* All pull requests include related and logical chunks of functionality, and are named and documented to clearly communicate the purpose of the pull request
